## Whoami

Hello everyone! My name is Matthew David, and I am currently a penetration tester working in the USA. As of late, I've been doing a lot of independent research in order to improve my skill set. While I've improved greatly, I wouldn't have been able to do it without the publicly available resources provided by some of the best souls in the industry. This blog serves as a place for me to publish some of my own research in hopes that others in the offensive security community can learn in a similar way that I do.
